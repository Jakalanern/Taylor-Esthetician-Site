        Enzyme Therapy - DMK is the only company in the world to utilize the
        beneficial effects of transfer-messenger enzymes. Enzymes are living
        substances that regulate health and work with certain minerals in the
        body to form a natural system of antioxidants that fight corrosive free
        radicals. Properly formulated, they can remove dead protein, toxins, and
        other effluvia from the epidermis using a process called ‘reverse
        osmosis’.
